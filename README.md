<h1>Mzodal</h1>
<p>A lightweight modal library for use with jQuery and ASP.NET MVC.</p>
<p>This project is on-going and currently only intended to give an example of my programming style. Provided is an ASP.NET MVC (Visual Studio 2013) solution which gives basic examples for its intended usage, though not all features are demonstrated at present.
